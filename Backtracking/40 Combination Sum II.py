'''
You are given an array of integers candidates, which may contain duplicates, and a target integer target. Your task is to return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target.

Each element from candidates may be chosen at most once within a combination. The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

You may return the combinations in any order and the order of the numbers in each combination can be in any order.
Input: candidates = [9,2,2,4,6,1,5], target = 8

Output: [
  [1,2,5],
  [2,2,4],
  [2,6]
]

# We can use backtracking to generate all combinations whose sum equals the given target. When the input array contains duplicate elements, it may result in duplicate combinations. To avoid this, we can sort the array. Why does sorting help? Because as we traverse the array from left to right, we form combinations with the current element. By skipping duplicate elements, we ensure that the same combinations are not repeated for identical elements.
# Time complexity: O(nâˆ—2^n)
# Space complexity: (n)

            if i >= len(candidates) or total > target:
                return
            cur.append(candidates[i])
            dfs(i + 1, cur, total + candidates[i])
            cur.pop()

            while i + 1 < len(candidates) and candidates[i] == candidates[i + 1]:
                i += 1
