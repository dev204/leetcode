'''
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

# TC O(n)
# If the total number of characters in the list of strings is n, The output string res will take O(n) space
# The extra characters (lengths and #) are small compared to n and still grow linearly â†’ so total space is O(n)
