'''
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

import collections


# we need to find a way to track the total numbers in a row, col and a box
# we can have a hashmap for each of these
# trick to keep track of box is we divide (r,c) by 3, ie (r//3,c//3)
# with this way 01 denotes first box, 02 denotes second ... and so on
# TC O(n.n) SC O(n.n) where n is dimension of the board
